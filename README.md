# Learning-R-3-Unsupervised-Learing-Feature-Selection-Association-Analysis-Dimensionality-Reduction

# Project Description

The goal of this project is to analyze retail data and come up with conclusions and recommendations that will inform the marketing department of a Kenyan retail company on the most relevant marketing strategies that will result in the highest no. of sales (total price including tax). 

This project has been divided into four parts where we explore a recent marketing dataset by performing various unsupervised learning techniques and later provide recommendations based on our insights. Below are four parts of the analysis:

## Part 1: Dimensionality Reduction
This section of the project entails reducing the dataset to a low dimensional dataset using the t-SNE algorithm or PCA.

## Part 2: Feature Selection
In this section, we perform feature selection through the use of several unsupervised learning methods so asn to provide insights on the features that contribute the most information to the dataset.

## Part 3: Association Rules
For this section, we create association rules that will allow us to identify relationships between variables in the dataset. This section uses a separate dataset that comprises of groups of items that will be associated with others.

## Part 4: Anomaly Detection
For this section, we check whether there are any anomalies in the provided sales dataset. The main objective of this task being fraud detection.
